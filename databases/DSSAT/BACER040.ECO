$ECOTYPES:BACER040

! Coefficients presented here differ from those used in DSSAT 
! Version 3.5. They have been developed from 'parameters'
! embedded in the code of the Ceres model,from the Cropsim model,
! and from the literature. They are likely to change as more
! experience is gained, and should not yet be taken as fixed.
!
! The DS35xx ecotypes are presented as trial sets for use with 
! cultivar coefficients converted from V3.5 values. In selecting 
! an ecotype to associate with converted cultivar coefficients, 
! the xx value should be matched with the PHINT value found in 
! the cultivar file. 
!
! Users who wish to 'experiment' by changing some coefficients
! are advised to concentrate first on the following:
!   Phenology                P1
!   Growth - general         LA1S, LAVS, LAWRS, LAWR2, PARUV, PARUR
!   Growth - water shortage  RDGS1, RDGS2
! Users should be extremely cautious in changing the stress response 
! thresholds (WFPU,NFPU,etc). It is possible that ecotypes differ in 
! these characteristics, but the extent of such differences is not
! well understood. However, users should be aware that the threshold 
! water supply/demand ratio at which water shortage begins to affect 
! photosynthsis (WFPU) is greater than that (1.0) at which water 
! shortage begins to affect transpiration. If it is felt that this 
! is irrealistic,the WFPU parameter could be changed to 1.0

! In Ceres3.5, P1=300 for PHINT=75; P2=225; P3=150; P4=200,
! with anthesis occurring in P4 after 60 units.
