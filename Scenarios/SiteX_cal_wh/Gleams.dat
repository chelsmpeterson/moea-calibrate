= ITEM NO.   DESCRIPTION
= --------   -----------
= DAREA		Drainage area of the field
= CHS		Hydraulic slope: slope of the longest flow path (LFP)
=		CHS = (ELEVmax - ELEVmin) / LFP
= WLW		Watershed length::width ratio
=		WLW = LFP^2 / (DAREA * 10000)  for metric (DAREA=ha, LFP=m)
=		WLW = LFP^2 / (DAREA * 43560)  for english (DARE=ac, LFP=ft)
= BYEAR		Four-digit year when simulation begins
= EYEAR		Four-digit year when simulation ends
= EROOUT	Code for output:

=			1  detailed annual summary
=			2  abbreviated monthly and annual summary
=			3  detailed monthly and annual summary
=			4  abbreviated storm-by-storm and summary
=			5  detailed storm-by-storm and summary

=			3  overland-channel
=			4  overland-channel-channel
=			5  overland-channel-impoundment
=			6  overland-channel-channel-impoundment
= METFLG	Code for metrication: 0 = english units; 1 = metric units
= SSCLY		Specific surface area for clay particles (m^2/g)
=		Suggested values: 20.0 for kaolinite, 800.0 for montmorillonite
= NPTSO		Number of points for overland flow profile slope (Max = 10)		
= DAOVR		Drainage area represented by the overland flow profile
=		Units = acres or hectacres
= XOV(nptso)	Distance from upper end of overland flow profile to the point
= 		where slope is given. Units = ft or m		
= SLOV(nptso)	Slope of the overland flow profile at the XOV. ft/ft or m/m
= NXK		Number (1 to 4) of slope segments differentiated by changes in 
=		soil erodibility factor
= XSOIL(nxk)	Relative horizontal distance from top to bottom of the slope.
=		Last value must be 1.0.
= KSOIL(nxk)	Soil erodibility factor for the slop segment just above XSOIL
=		Units = ton/ac or t.ha.h/ha.MJ.mm
= NYEARS	Number of years in this rotation
= CDATE(10)	The Julian days on which sets of parameters take effect.
= NXF		Number (1 to 4) of overland flow profile segments 
=		differentiated by changes in the overland flow updateable
=		(annual) parameters
= XFACT(nxf)	Relative horizontal distance from the top of the overland flow
=		profile to the bottof segment (ratio of distance to bottom of 
=		segment to total profile length)
= CFACT(nxf,nyears)	Soil loss ratio for overland flow profile segment
= PFACT(nxf,nyears)	Contouring factor for overland flow profile segment
= NFACT(nxf,nyears)	Mannings 'n' for overland flow profile segment.
